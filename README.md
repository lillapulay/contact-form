# contact-form

Working contact form created following a tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg4e-FObyJ8.
This test document uses 3 inputs (email, subject, message).
Validation was written with jQuery.
Validation results (valid/invalid) regarding each field are shown in a div under the submit button.
If all fields have been filled out correctly and validation passes, Formspree is used to send the message to the email address specified my account on formspree.io.
Styling is minimal, as the point of this test was the actual functionality (validation + sending the message).
